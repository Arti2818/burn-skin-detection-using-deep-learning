# burn-skin-detection-using-deep-learning
This project focuses on the development of a robust burn skin detection system utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically VGG16, resnet50, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with 11 and 23 layers and YOLO V5 models. The primary goal is to classify burn injuries into different degrees (first, second, and third degree) and distinguish non-burn instances. The motivation behind this project is to provide a reliable tool for medical triage in areas with limited access to advanced healthcare technologies, enabling prompt and accurate identification of burn severity.

The dataset includes images representing different degrees of burn injuries, as well as non-burn samples. To enhance the model's generalization capabilities, a dataset reconstruction process is implemented, addressing potential biases and improving the network's ability to handle real-world variations in skin appearance.
